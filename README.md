# Challenge2-TheCloneWars
Build a website from scratch to match the mock-up provided without crying...too much. 
## Description

Given the mock-up provided, the website should be built from scratch with original code that shows at least some retention of basic to moderate html and css instructions.

## Usage

By implementing what could be deciphered from rapid-fire instructions, the creator has demonstrated at least some sense of how to replicate the mock-up.
